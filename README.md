# Modulator

Powerful component management for Mithril

> Modulator was developped in late 2014 when Mithril was at v0.1 & had no mechanisms for nested component instantiation. Mithril brought out its own API for equivalent functionality via `m.component` as of v0.2 in 05/15 (and as a `m` overload in v0.2.5 in 12/15). Modulator is no longer maintained - this repository exists solely for as a bookmark for nostaligc reasons.
